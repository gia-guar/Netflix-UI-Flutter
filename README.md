## Challenges and what I'm learning
*I'm slowly getting familiar with Flutter. I coded up the theme "from scratch" without making use of consumers and providers since I'm not too familiar with them yet. Also experimenting with animated buttons packages was fun. This may help some newcomers like me to learn quickly how to set up a modern looking UI.*
